1) Better prompt templates & styles

Why it matters: Your summaries will stop being inconsistent. The model will stop rambling.
What to implement:

Define 3–4 fixed summary “modes”:

Simple TL;DR (2–3 lines)

Bullet points (3 bullets, max 10 words each)

Explain like I’m 5

Hinglish casual summary

Set strict constraints in every template: “no filler”, “no intro”, “no repeating”, “max X sentences,” etc.
This instantly levels up output quality without touching backend logic.

2) Token budgeting & model parameters

Why it matters: Prevent token errors + cut cost + speed up response.
What to implement:

Set maximum output tokens (you don’t need huge outputs to summarize).

Use low temperature (0.1–0.3) for summaries — cleaner and consistent.

For short inputs, skip chunking; for long inputs, enforce chunking.

Decide which model to use for each preset (cheap vs strong model).

This stops random behavior and token waste.

3) Rate limits, quotas & cost controls

Why it matters: Without this your bill explodes and users spam the API.
What to implement:

Per-user daily cap (e.g., 10 free summaries/day).

Hard limit per IP for anonymous usage.

Reject extremely long inputs unless user is paid tier.

Log token usage per request to monitor cost.

Set quotas in Google Cloud so you can’t accidentally burn money.

This keeps the system under control even if traffic spikes.

4) UI/UX improvements (client-side only)

Why it matters: Users blame your backend when your frontend is bad.
What to implement:

A dropdown selector for summary style/mode.

A clear loading animation for long texts.

A clean preview box showing the summary with copy button.

Let user edit summary inside UI.

Save history (last 5 summaries) in local storage.

Better UX makes even a basic summarizer look premium.

5) Cost/quality presets for users

Why it matters: Lets you upsell and control model usage smartly.
What to implement:
Preset types like:

Fast & Cheap → quick model, short output, small token budget.

Balanced → mid-tier model, moderate tokens.

Detailed → high-tier model, expanded tokens, slower.

User feels in control, you stay in control of costs.
